# Article-template-APA
APA article template in LaTeX for Overleaf

Here you will find the template for an APA manuscript created in Overleaf. 
As I am a Psychology student, this was created with APA formatting and referencing.

To use it, click on the button 'clone or download', and 'download ZIP'. 
Go to Overleaf at www.overleaf.com (and create an account if you don't already have one). Click on 'new project' and then 'upload project'. Navigate to the 'Article-template-master' ZIP file that downloaded onto your computer, or drag and drop it into the window. Ta da! You can now work on your article using the template provided.

** More details **

There are two options for the layout that you would like to use, which are defined on the very first line of the template.
For a single column, double spaced manuscript, un-comment the first option: '\documentclass[man,12pt]{apa6}'.
For a two column journal layout article, un-comment the second option: '\documentclass[jou,12pt]{apa6}'. (One of the options should always be commented out.)

In the left-hand navigation bar you will see one folder: 'images'. This is where you should upload any images that you want to use.
You will also see a file called 'main.tex'. This file contains all of the settings and is where you should write your article. 


If you are new to LaTeX and Overleaf, I direct you to the Overleaf documentation page (https://www.overleaf.com/learn), which is very helpful.

At the moment this is a very simple template, and you will be able to find many more online. If you would like me to add any other examples or explanations, feel free to ask!

Happy writing!
